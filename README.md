# CSV-Reformatter
This reformats CSV files to have the data displayed in each column and not in a grid view where titles are displayed on the start of rows and columns. 

I originally made this script for work as I had to transform the data, so it was readable for the SaaS I was using. However, I thought other people could make use of this.

Not much to it but it works.
